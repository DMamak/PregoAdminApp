This app is developed for College Assigment.It is admin side of food ordering app, For the first assigment the app has hardcoded dummy data
which later will be replaced with firebase. When the user opens the app,the first thing he sees is List of orders made by a Recycler View.
if the user click on the order then a new activity is opened up which lets him update the status of the order or delete the order.
the floating button at the bottom right of the screen when pressed lets the user add a new Order.
on right side of the tool bar there is menu which lets the user navigate between Pizza menu activity and Toppings List activity.
both of the activites let user use the floating button to add new Pizzas or Toppings.
Clicking on a pizza in the Pizza Menu Recycler view opens up updating and deleting options, where if user clicks on the topping Recycler View,
it only lets him delete it.

# Persistence
The persistance used in this app only lasts while the app is running, upon exiting it clears any new items added other than the dummy data.
During the duration of the App if users adds any new toppings or pizzas they will avaiable to be choosen by the user when creating a new Pizza or Order.

# GitHub
github was used only at the end of the project for complete upload.

# UX
The Ux taken for this assigment was to keep everything simple without adding alot of the designs to the app, which will be improved in Assigment 2

# DX
Data Validation was added to options where users add new Items.
Currently lack of Automated Testing.
